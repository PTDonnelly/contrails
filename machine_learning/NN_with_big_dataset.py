# Certainly! Below is a step-by-step abstracted code template for loading and training on a large dataset of .csv files using TensorFlow and Keras. This template is designed to be adapted to your specific dataset and training requirements.

# ### Step 1: Import TensorFlow

# ```python
# import tensorflow as tf
# ```

# ### Step 2: Define File Pattern and Create Dataset

# ```python
# # Define the pattern matching your CSV files
# file_pattern = "path/to/csv/files/*.csv"
# file_list = tf.io.gfile.glob(file_pattern)

# # Create a dataset from the CSV files
# raw_dataset = tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset(
#     file_list,
#     batch_size=32,  # Adjust as needed
#     num_epochs=1,  # Set to None for indefinite repetition
#     shuffle=True,
#     shuffle_buffer_size=10000,  # Adjust based on your dataset size
#     num_parallel_reads=tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE,
#     prefetch_buffer_size=tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE,
#     label_name='label_column_name'  # Adjust to your label column
# )
# ```

# ### Step 3: Define Preprocessing Function

# ```python
# def preprocess_function(features):
#     # Implement preprocessing logic here
#     # Example: features['feature_name'] = preprocess_operation(features['feature_name'])
#     return features
# ```

# ### Step 4: Apply Preprocessing

# ```python
# # Map the preprocessing function to the dataset
# processed_dataset = raw_dataset.map(preprocess_function)
# ```

# ### Step 5: Build Your Model

# ```python
# model = tf.keras.Sequential([
#     # Add layers according to your model architecture
#     tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=128, activation='relu'),
#     tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')  # Adjust based on your output
# ])

# model.compile(
#     optimizer='adam',
#     loss='binary_crossentropy',  # Adjust based on your problem
#     metrics=['accuracy']
# )
# ```

# ### Step 6: Train the Model

# ```python
# model.fit(processed_dataset, epochs=10)  # Adjust epochs and other training parameters as needed
# ```

# This template provides a flexible starting point for working with large datasets of .csv files. You'll need to adjust file paths, preprocessing logic, model architecture, and training parameters based on your specific dataset and problem.
